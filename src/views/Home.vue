          <h1>Jared Leach</h1>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm Jared. I'm a web developer in central Oklahoma.
            I wrote my first lines of HTML when I was 8 years old,
            to customize an AOL Hometown page. When I was 13, I
            went deeper with XHTML, CSS, and some basic JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did some freelance web development in my teenage years,
            and at 17 I began college and soon earned an Associate
            degree in Web Development Technology from Rose State College.
          </p>
          <p>
            After working in the field for several years, I returned to
            university and completed a bachelor's degree from Liberty
            University.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021 I continue to learn and work full-time as a web developer.
            In particular, I'm spending more time with Vue 3, PHP 8, and NodeJS.
          </p>
          <h2>Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>I'm a nerd.</strong> I love tech. Whether I'm watching WWDC,
            running an experiment with a Raspberry Pi, or configuring a reverse-
            proxy with nginx, I'm having fun with technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I'm an Oklahoman.</strong> I was born in Oklahoma, and have
            lived here my entire life. I'm excited to see Oklahoma develop a
            robust technology industry, while maintaining its rural beauty and
            historic landmarks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I'm a Christian.</strong> Growing up in the faith, I began
            learning the basics of Biblical Hebrew when I was eleven years old,
            and learned the basics of Biblical Greek when I was sixteen. I'm
            currently spending time listening to theologians across various
            Christian traditions, returning to Greek, and developing a greater
            interest in Church history; particularly in the apostolic and 
            ante-nicene eras.
